# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


It is a tic tac toe game.

U can play this with your friends or with computer.

Its a fun game to show in your projects because it does not take much skills but it can show your level of knowledge on react.
to run this on web you need to first .

1. npm install.
2. npm run dev.
